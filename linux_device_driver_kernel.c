-Lecture_10
        -(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhNeyLcYyiw&list=PLX3M4Mi-TS8HXW85l_zPXpYRnrEIXCbyu&index=24)
        -iterrupt and linux kernel
    -using dtc to diassembly from dtb to dts -> (46:24)
        ->dtc -I dtb -O dts *.dtb > all.dts (46:43)
    ->Hiearchy between GPIO<->GPC<->GIC<->CPU (54:52)
    ->in gpio_key_drv.c, it has init() for platform_driver_register() and probe() for setting up w.r.t device tree (1:10:10)
        -Need to check platform_device_register() for dirver.c ->https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/arch/arm/mach-orion5x/ts78xx-setup.c#L98
    ->Go through (1:10:00) and before hand->quite challenging
    ->After (1:10:10)->Example and tuning
->Lecture 11 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGGdb5R-Fro&list=PLX3M4Mi-TS8HXW85l_zPXpYRnrEIXCbyu&index=21&t=794s)
    -Non blocking interrupt
    -blocking interrrupt and wake up (38:54)
    -LInux 内核源代码情景分析 (1:43:31)
    -signal handling != sempahore as 信号量 (2:03:44)
->Lecture 12->
    ->POLLIN and POLLOUT for sound card (2:59)
    ->ret!=POLL_IN then ret!=POLL_OUT (6:45)
    ->Hardware interrupt and virtual(Software) interrupt with GIC (25:58)
    ->sysfs with GPIO (36:27)
    ->Do we need to consider synchronization in device driver ?
        -For android Yes since multiple app may need to access it
        -For linux, we don't since maybe only one app access the device driver (41:39)
        -assign GPIO interrupt to GIC (44:49)
    ->Lwer layer eg GPIO0 needs to register to GIC (55:26)
    ->drv_open->get 互次量 as semaphore take locks
    ->drv_release-> release 信号量 as signal (1:00:03)

-1)i2c using character device driver approach NOT platform approach
    -The reason for using character device driver is need to return sth to the application layer as copy_to
  ->Lecture 22.3->https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fJ411i7PB?p=77&vd_source=352d86e561ef82fd069e1251bfae8933

  -Lecture 22.4->https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fJ411i7PB?p=78&vd_source=352d86e561ef82fd069e1251bfae8933
  -Lecture 22.5->
  -Lecture 22.6
->spi 
  -Lecture 23.1
  -Lecture 23.2
    -using "ioremap" in other vendors spi controller (26:17)
    -NXP->using much more complex way to do so such as using structure of bibang (26:17)
   -Lecture 23.3->SPI driver
      ->spi_device
      ->spi_driver (6:40)(7:16)
    -(13:55)
  -Lecture 23.4
    -(7:31)
    -the rest will be really similar to I2C part for character driver (14:12)
    -Why don't we use platform driver into I2C and SPI?
    -The reason is that I2C and SPI has its own hiearchy architecture therefore we need to use it. For the platform driver->we ONLY utilize this one if there is no built in hierachy or architecture (15:27)
    -Be aware that even though it is a platform driver, we still need to creacte character device (15:00)
    -Need to use LINUX kernel API to read/write SPI (18:58)
    -SPI transfer async and sync (25:23)
  -Lecture 23.5
      - (00:34)
      -using external GPIO as chip select (00:45)
      -rests skip for now**********************************************************
  -Lecture 24.1_UART
      - (00:42)(1:32)
      -UART_port and UART_driver (4:56)
      -Be aware of uart_ops (10:04)
      - TTY and UART are combined (14:00)
      -IOMAP (21:01) with base address then start to use base address (21:02)
      -uart may support RS-485 but required more configuration (23:14)
  -Lecture 24.2_UART
      - (4:12)
      -Need to know if UART1 <->ttymc0->we need to check manually (10:54)
     -Instead of writing app to do the test->we could use minocom to do so (11:51)
  -Lecture 24.3_porting ncursees
      -be aware that don't mess up between ARM and x86 otherwise things may not work (15:59)
      -need to edit /etc/passwrd ->relate sth for user name and password (30:22)
  -Lecture 24.4_UART
    -be aware of jumper (1:48)
    -How to set up minicom (4:33)
    -minicom need to clear the screen (10:30)
