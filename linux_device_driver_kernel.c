-1)i2c using character device driver approach NOT platform approach
    -The reason for using character device driver is need to return sth to the application layer as copy_to

  -Lecture 22.5->
  -Lecture 22.6
->spi 
  -Lecture 23.1
  -Lecture 23.2
    -using "ioremap" in other vendors spi controller (26:17)
    -NXP->using much more complex way to do so such as using structure of bibang (26:17)
   -Lecture 23.3->SPI driver
      ->spi_device
      ->spi_driver (6:40)(7:16)
    -(13:55)
  -Lecture 23.4
    -(7:31)
    -the rest will be really similar to I2C part for character driver (14:12)
    -Why don't we use platform driver into I2C and SPI?
    -The reason is that I2C and SPI has its own hiearchy architecture therefore we need to use it. For the platform driver->we ONLY utilize this one if there is no built in hierachy or architecture (15:27)
    -Be aware that even though it is a platform driver, we still need to creacte character device (15:00)
